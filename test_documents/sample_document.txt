# Welcome to the RAG Pipeline Test

This is a sample document to test your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline.

## What is RAG?

RAG combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base. This allows AI agents to answer questions based on specific documents and data.

## How it works:

1. Documents are processed and split into chunks
2. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using the nomic-embed-text model
3. Embeddings are stored in a Supabase vector database
4. When a user asks a question, the agent searches for relevant chunks
5. The agent uses the retrieved information to generate accurate responses
