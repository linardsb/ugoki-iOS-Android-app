The Problem

As busy professionals we work long hours, get exhausted and our productivity drops. We can become demotivated
understand the life cycle of a product. and our health can suffer. We eat on the run and frequently don’t eat properly. We don’t have enough time to find out
about good nutrition, exercise and other healthy habits that will increase our well-being.

In fact, lack of sleep, exercise and good nutrients can significantly increase the chance of Alzheimer’s and cancer. And
also lead to allergies, bloating, inflammation and brain fog.

Let’s look at an example. Oscar is leading an important sales pitch in the morning at his company. He prepares weeks
in advance and he stays up very late the night before to make sure he has everything covered. In an attempt to stay
focused, Oscar drinks a couple of coffees, a Red Bull, has a quick bite as he works.

How does Oscar feel on the morning of the presentation? Not great. The lack of sleep and caffeine have made him
tense and he’s ‘not on the ball’. The meeting went OK, but it could have been great if Oscar had been relaxed, focused
and had a clear state of mind.




Target Market

schedule or other business activities, however who still appreciate the value of physical activities.

User profiles

Profile - Arthur (35)

Arthur is a manager at a buzzing real estate agency office in London city, agency has many high profile customers who are looking
for best quality office space or living area to rent/buy in central London. Naturally Arthur’s schedule is very active, and there is
rarely any real time for an hours break, if Arthur can free some time for lunch, usually it is a sandwich at the desk or on the go. In his
spare time on weekends Arthur likes to socialise, cook some delicious food with his friends and family, as he’s single at the
moment. Arthur used to play rugby throughout his secondary school and university. He was really considering taking on gym
classes, however it was too much of an effort and time because of the schedule.

Profile - Eleanore (42)

Eleanore is mother of three children (2yo; 4yo; and 7 yo). She is a senior trader at Merrill Lynch office in London. Eleanore’s day
consists of deep data analysis; spotting industry trends; implement test plans; understand performance objectives to set
programmatic strategies etc. Eleanore likes to keep everything on schedule and her breaks are always on time at 1pm. She
understands the value and long term benefits of exercise and right nutrition. Currently she is a member of a local gym, however
does not find a value of a traditional workout to be working for her. When Eleanore is at home it is often late for her to cook and
put kids to sleep, but she would love to be able to do that herself. On the weekends there is always loads of activities around kids
(swimming, tae kwon-do, dance, horse-back riding, birthday parties etc.). Eleanore really enjoys socialising with her friends on
weekends too, plus there is always time needed for her own projects (studying, reading, chess).



The Product (Solution) / Market positioning

The platform is designed to successfully optimise our customers health activities around their agenda.
Commonly users would free 15-25 minutes of their time for a physical HIIT workout, which would still give people time
for lunch, if they would like to break fast after training. There are few other ways to make IF work for different times of
the day, or any other time they feel comfortable with. When people have reached the comfortable level with 16/8
Protocol, there is a 24h Protocol for increased level of benefits from IF, however this should not be practiced more than
once in couple of weeks. The most common way to do IF is to use 16/8 Protocol - Fasting for 16 hours and then only
eating within a specific 8-hour window. For example, only eating from noon-8 PM, essentially skipping breakfast.

• If you start eating at: 7AM, stop eating and start fasting at 3PM
• If you start eating at: 11AM, stop eating and start fasting at 7PM
• If you start eating at: 2PM, stop eating and start fasting at 10PM
• If you start eating at: 6PM, stop eating and start fasting at 2AM

The above routine will be a part of suggested feature list of the application, that can be easily personalised. In
combination of the above features, customers will be able to socialise with other platform members to organise clubs
and gatherings, collaborative activities to work towards personal goals of IF.



Addressing the problem: 

Sven is a sales lead at the sales department in Bloomberg EMEA office in London. His schedule is extremely busy
because of the fact that he deals with multiple time zones for his sales meetings. He rarely has time to have the whole
hour off for him. To remedy the situation Sven has a reminder set up on the platform when it is time for him go for a 20
minute HIIT workout 10 minutes away from the office less crowded area. Workout was arranged with Anthony when
they both were on the platform trying to see if anyone else will go for a workout.

Right after the workout Seven receives a notification on his mobile phone about what stage he is now, and how far it is
to get to one his goals - endurance increase, he arranged when setting up his user account. The above is just one goal
Sven has set up for himself, one other goal is to increase his focus and concentration levels through IF and diet.

On the way to the office Sven goes in to a supermarket, there he scans the food items for a home delivery. Items he
scanned were suggested by the platform from various, nutritious recipes of KETO diet he was reading about in the
blog on the way to work that day. After returning to the office Sven still has time to order the grocery list for a delivery
to his address in the evening. All Sven has to do now, is prepare the items that were delivered to his home, and add
those in the slow cooker for dinner to be ready for tomorrow.
